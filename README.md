- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jorge Chamby-Diaz (@jchambyd), a Ph.D. student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), a Researcher in the Multi-Agent Systems research group (MASLAB), a Machine Learning Engineer at Cloud2Go company, and a Data Science Professor at Ada Tech.
- ðŸ‘€ My main research area is Machine Learning, especially data streams, concept-drift, ensemble methods, and complex networks.
- ðŸŒ± My research is highly interdisciplinary. Therefore, despite my goal to generate new advances in Machine Learning, I strongly focus on promoting its application in Recommendation Systems and Predictive Models to solve challenging and significant problems.
