- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jorge Chamby-Diaz (@jchambyd), a Ph.D. in Computer Science and currently work as a Data Science Specialist at Samsung R&D, alongside my role as a Data Science Professor at Ada Tech.
- ðŸ‘€ My primary research focus is Machine Learning, with particular interests in data streams, concept drift, ensemble methods, and complex networks.
- ðŸŒ± My research is highly interdisciplinary. Therefore, despite my goal to generate new advances in Machine Learning, I strongly focus on promoting its application in Recommendation Systems and Predictive Models to solve challenging and significant problems.
